# Reactjs Tutorial

## Q1 React?
  React.js is an open-source Javascript library for building user interfaces. It primarily used for single-page applications where user interactions are dynamic and often require updating parts of the page without a full reload. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/home)

## Q2 React Introduction?
 React is a popular open-source javascript library for building Frontend Single Page Applications (SPAs).React was created by Jordan Walke and was first used in Facebook's Newsfeed. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/introduction)

 ## Q3 Getting Started with React?
 To get started with React, we can use the `create-react-app` command which is an officially supported way to create new React applications with a predefined project structure and build configuration. A basic understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript is required. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/get-started)
 
 ## Q4 Upgrade React Version?
  Upgrading a React application involves updating the version of React and other related packages in your project [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/upgrade-version)
  
## Q5 JSX?
  JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows us to write XML or HTML-like code within your JavaScript files. JSX is often associated with React, but it is a standalone syntax that can be used with other libraries or frameworks. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/jsx)
  
 ## Q6 JSX Rendering?
  JSX stands for Javascript XML formally known as (Javascript Syntax Extension) and is used to define what the UI should look like. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML and makes it easier to write and visualize the structure of React components.

## Q7 React Components?
  In React, components are the building blocks of a user interface. A React application is composed of multiple components, each responsible for rendering a part of the UI.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/components)

## Q8 React Classes?
 In React, Components are the building blocks of application. class components were a traditional way of creating components before the introduction of functional components and hooks. Class components extend the React.Component class and have a more verbose syntax compared to functional components.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/react-class)
  
## Q9 Props?
  In React, props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props are arguments that we pass to a React component from one component to another component.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/props)

## Q10 Events in React?
   In React, Events are interactions or occurrences triggered by users or other sources. Handling events in React is similar to handling events in regular HTML, but there are some differences due to the nature of React components. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/events)
   
## Q11 Conditionals Rendering?
  Conditional rendering in React involves rendering different content or components based on certain conditions. This can be achieved using Javascript expressions and conditional statements within your JSX code.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/conditionals)
  
## Q12 Lists Rendering in React?
  In React, Rendering lists of items is a common task. To display multiple records at a time.
  We can render lists using the "map()" function to iterate over an array of data and generate a set of components for each item.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/react-lists)  
  
## Q13 Forms?
   In React, forms are a crucial part of building interactive user interfaces. Managing form data and handling form submissions involves using React state and event handling.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/react-forms)
  
## Q14 React Memo?
 React.memo is a higher-order component in React that's used for optimizing functional components by preventing unnecessary re-renders. It's similar to the PureComponent for class components. When we wrap a component with React.memo, it will only re-render if its props have changed. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/react-memo)

## Q15 Hooks Introductions?
 React Hooks are functions that enable functional components to manage state, side effects, and other React features. Before the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, state and lifecycle methods were primarily associated with class components.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/hooks-introduction)
 
## Q16 useState Hooks?
   useState is a React Hook that allows functional components to manage the state internally. Before the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, state management was primarily associated with class components.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/usestate)
   
## Q17 useEffect Hooks?
   In React, useEffect is a React Hook that enables functional components to perform side effects. Side effects may include data fetching, subscriptions, manual DOM manipulations, or any other operation that isn't purely related to rendering.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/useeffect)

## Q18 useContext Hooks?
 useContext is a React Hook that allows functional components to subscribe to a context. React useContext hook provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/usecontext)

## Q19 useRef Hook?
  useRef is a React Hook that provides a mutable object called a ref object. Refs are primarily used to interact with the DOM or to persist values across renders without causing re-renders. `useRef` Hook gives direct access to manipulate DOM elements, manage timers, store mutable values, or preserve values across component re-renders without causing re-renders.

## Q20 useReducer Hooks?
  useReducer is a React hook used for managing more complex state logic in functional components. It is particularly useful when state transitions depend on the previous state or when the next state is calculated based on the current state and an action. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/usereducer)
  
## Q21 useCallback Hooks?
 useCallback is a React hook that is used to memoize functions in functional components. It is particularly useful when we want to prevent unnecessary re-creations of functions, especially when passing functions as props to child components. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/react/usecallback)
 
## Q22 useMemo Hook?
 useMemo is a React hook used for memoizing values, particularly expensive computations or calculations, to optimize performance in functional components. It memoizes the result of a function and returns the memoized value, avoiding unnecessary recalculations when the component re-renders.
